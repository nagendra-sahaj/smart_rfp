1,Are there contradictions between the scope of works sections in different parts of the RFP?,"The RFP defines scope of works in two places. In one section, the scope is limited to civil and structural works for substations. In another, the scope expands to include grid connectivity and related civil works. This creates ambiguity about whether the contractor is responsible for grid‑level civil works beyond substations."
2,"Do the guaranteed losses mentioned in different sections align, or are there inconsistencies?","Guaranteed losses are mentioned in multiple places. In one section, the acceptable loss is capped at a specific percentage, while another section specifies a different threshold. This inconsistency poses contractual risk, as bidders may interpret obligations differently."
3,Summarize the process for evaluating technical bids before financial bids are opened.,"RFP specifies that technical bids are evaluated first against compliance with technical specifications, data requirement sheets, and scope of works. Only bidders who meet the minimum technical criteria are considered for financial evaluation. The financial bids are opened subsequently, and evaluation is based on quoted costs and adherence to financial conditions."
4,List risks associated with civil and structural works mentioned in the RFP.,"Risks include unclear scope boundaries, dependency on grid connectivity, and potential penalties for delays. Civil works obligations are scattered across multiple subsections, making interpretation difficult and increasing execution risk."
5,Extract line items from the Data Requirement Sheets (DRS) related to electrical works.,"The DRS includes items such as cabling, switchgear, and transformers, each with specified units and quantities. These line items form the basis for technical compliance and cost estimation."
